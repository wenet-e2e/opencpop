# What is WeSing?

WeSing is a pupublicly available high-quality Mandarin singing corpus, which is designed for singing voice synthesis (SVS) systems. The corpus consists of 100 unique Mandarin songs, which was recorded by a professional female singer. The audio files were recorded with studio-quality at a sampling rate of 44100 Hz in a professional recording studio environment.

All singing recordings have been phonetically annotated with utterance/note/phoneme boundaries and pitch types. The final dataset contain 3756 utterances, about 6.9 hours. We randomly choose 5 songs as standard test set, and provided baseline results to the researchers.

Human voice is one of the most beautiful instruments. Let’s create usable singing voice synthesis technology for humanity. Enjoy!
