## What is opencpop?

Opencpop, a publicly available high-quality Mandarin singing corpus, is designed for singing voice synthesis (SVS) systems. This corpus consists of 100 unique Mandarin songs, which were recorded by a professional female singer. All audio files were recorded with studio-quality at a sampling rate of 44,100 Hz in a professional recording studio environment.

All singing recordings have been phonetically annotated with utterance/note/phoneme boundaries and pitch types. The final dataset contains 3,756 utterances, with a total of about 6.9 hours. The testing set consists of 5 randomly chosen songs, and baseline synthesized results are provided.

The human voice is one of the most beautiful instruments. Letâ€™s create usable singing voice synthesis technology for humanity. Enjoy!
