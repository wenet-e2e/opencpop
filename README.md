## What is WeSing?

WeSing is a pupublicly available high-quality Mandarin singing corpus, which is designed for singing voice synthesis (SVS) systems. The corpus consists of 100 unique Mandarin songs, which was recorded by a professional female singer. The audio files were recorded with studio-quality at a sampling rate of 44100 Hz in a professional recording studio environment.

All singing recordings have been phonetically annotated with utterance/note/phoneme boundaries and pitch types. The final dataset contain 3756 utterances, about 6.9 hours. We randomly choose 5 songs as standard test set, and provided baseline results to the researchers.

Human voice is one of the most beautiful instruments. Letâ€™s create usable singing voice synthesis technology for humanity. Enjoy!
